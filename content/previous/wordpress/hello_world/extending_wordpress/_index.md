# Extending WordPress

Now that we've covered the basics, it's time to start extending our WordPress site! 

One of the simplest and most common ways of doing this is by utilising small chunks of code others have already written and packaged up for us specifically for WordPress, called **Plugins**. Another way we can extend WordPress is by adding our own custom post types, custom fields or custom taxonomies.

In the next step we're going to add a contact form and a directory to our website using both of these methods.
