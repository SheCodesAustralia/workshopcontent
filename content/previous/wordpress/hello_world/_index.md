Congratulations, you've just set up your first WordPress installation!

Now comes the fun part, where we get to take a vanilla WordPress site and turn it into something that is uniquely our own. To do that, we first need to understand a little about how WordPress works.

We're going to quickly run you through some of the basics, but first we'll show you how to actually log in to the website you've just created.

The process for this may be a little different depending on whether you set your site up locally or in a hosted environment (like VentraIP). Generally speaking all WordPress websites are accessed the same way - through a web browser - however depending on whether your site is 'live' or 'local' the URL will be a little different.

# Logging in to a local install

If you chose option 1 and installed your site locally using XAMPP or MAMP, you will need to go to the following URL to log in:

For Mac Users:

[http://localhost:8888/wp_demo/wordpress/wp-admin](http://localhost:8888/wp_demo/wordpress/wp-admin)

For PC Users:

[http://localhost/wp_demo/wordpress/wp-admin](http://localhost/wp_demo/wordpress/wp-admin)

# Logging in to a live website

By default, all WordPress websites can be accessed by going to the URL and adding /wp-admin to the end of it. For example, if the URL you registered was mywpsite.co, you would login at

[https://mywpsite.co/wp-admin](https://mywpsite.co/wp-admin)

# Welcome to WordPress!

Regardless of which method you chose, the login page will look the same. You will need to use the username (or email) and password that you entered during the previous setup step.

 Once you have logged in, you should immediately be taken to the WordPress Dashboard.
