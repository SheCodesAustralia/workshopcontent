The images on our page are all enormous, so let's start by learning how to specify the size of elements.

## Step 1

Add the following to your CSS:


```diff
/* Your CSS here */

+img {
+	height: 100px;
+}

```

The tag selector will get every `img` element.
The `height` property changes the height of an element by whatever value you provide - in this case, we've specified 100 pixels (`px`).


{{% notice test %}}

Every image on the page should now have the same height.

{{% /notice %}}

Every image now has the same height, but if we have a look at our preview of the final product, we can see images of different sizes:

![Screenshot of completed webpage.](../../images/animals_complete.jpeg)

Instead of changing the height of all images in one go, let's start at the top of the page and, working our way top to bottom, resize each group of images.

## Step 2

If we take a look at the HTML, we can see that the first image is in the header.

Instead of setting the height of *every* image to `100px`, let's only set the height of the header image.

To do this, we can combine the header and image selectors, like so:

```diff
/* Your CSS here */

-img {
+header img {
	height: 100px;
}
```

We read this like: "select all the `img` tags that are in the `header` tag.

{{% notice test %}}

Only the first image will be `100px` in height, and the rest will return to their default sizes.

{{% /notice %}}

## Step 3

Working our way down, the next section has two images:

```html
<section class="row" id="section-2">
    <h2>Popular Photos</h2>
    <div>
        <img src="" />
        <img src="" />
    </div>
</section>
```

These images are both in a `div`, then in a `section` with id `section-2`.
Just as we did earlier, we can combine these selectors to specify only these two images:

```diff
/* Your CSS here */

header img {
	height: 100px;
}

+#section-2 div img {
+	width: 200px;
+}
```

{{% notice test %}}

The next two images will be `200px` wide.

{{% /notice %}}

## Step 4

The next three images are a bit different.
They are in white boxes, and each have a heading and paragraph to go with them:

![](../../images/animals_cards.jpeg)

Let's take a look at the HTML to see the structure of this part of the page:

```html
<section class="row" id="section-3">
    <div class="card">
        <img src="" />
        <h3>Amphibians</h3>
        <p>Including frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <img src="" />
        <h3>Squirrels</h3>
        <p> Including tree squirrels, ground squirrels and flying squirrels.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <img src="" />
        <h3>Elephants</h3>
        <p>Including the savanna elephant and the forest elephant.</p>
    </div>
</section>
```

Notice how these white boxes are all the same height?
Let's add some CSS for this.
From the HTML above we can see that each box is in a `div` with the class `card`.

Add a height to each of these cards:

```diff
#section-2 div img {
	width: 200px;
}

+.card {
+	height: 250px;
+}
```

Well, that definitely did something, but it did not resize the images.

Add the following to your CSS to now resize the images:

```diff
.card {
	height: 250px;
}

+.card img {
+	height: 40%;
+}
```

{{% notice test %}}

The images in the cards should now all be the same height.

{{% /notice %}}

The way we set the height of these images is a bit different to what we did previously.

Rather than specifying a value in pixels, we gave a percentage.
This CSS is saying "set the height of this element to be `40%` of the height of its parent (where **parent** means the element it is in, in this case, that is the card).

{{% notice tip %}}

This only works when the parent element has a specific size set.
Try removing `height: 250px` from the `.card` to see this for yourself!

{{% /notice %}}

## Step 5

So far we have just been setting the height, but we can actually set the width using the same format.
Let's modify our CSS to also set the width of the cards and their images.

```diff
.card {
	height: 250px;
+	width: 25%;   
}

.card img {
	height: 40%;
+   width: 100%;
}
```

{{% notice test %}}

The images should now be as wide as the cards.

{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice tip %}}

Our cards aren't side by side like they are in the preview - don't worry! We'll get to that soon!

{{% /notice %}}

## Step 6

{{% notice challenge %}}

This one is a challenge for you!
Find the image in the section with id `section-4` and set its `width` to `400px`.

{{% /notice %}}

## Step 7

The last section is `section-5` and has two images side by side.

Let's take a look at the structure of the HTML:

```html
<section class="row" id="section-5">
    <div class="column" id="left-column">
        <h2>Reptiles</h2>
        <img src="" />
    </div><!--
    --><div class="column" id="right-column">
        <h2>Birds</h2>
        <img src="" />
    </div>
</section>
```

Each of these images is in a `div` with class `column`.
Eventually, these columns will be side by side, which means they need to be `50%` wide each in order to fit beside each other.

{{% notice challenge %}}

Set the `width` of the divs with the `column` class to `50%`.

{{% /notice %}}

We will then resize the images inside of these columns.

{{% notice challenge %}}

For images inside the divs with the `column` class: set their `height` to `200px` and their `width` to `80%`.

{{% /notice %}}

Here's what your page should look like at this stage:
