We can also add lists in our HTML, there are two different kinds of lists we can use: **ordered** (numbered) and **unordered** (bulleted) lists.

A list is made up of multiple elements.
There is the `<ul>` or `<ol>` element itself, and then **list items** (`<li>`) inside it.

For example, the code below represents an ordered list:

```html
<h1>HTML and CSS Workshop</h1>

<ol>
    <li>Intro to HTML</li>
    <li>HTML Elements</li>
    <li>HTML Attributes</li>
    <li>Structure</li>
</ol>
```

This would render the following:
![The resulting webpage from the ordered list code snippet.](../../images/ordered_list.png)

The code below represents an unordered list:

```html
<h1>HTML and CSS Workshop</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Intro to HTML</li>
    <li>HTML Elements</li>
    <li>HTML Attributes</li>
    <li>Structure</li>
</ul>
```

This would render the following:
