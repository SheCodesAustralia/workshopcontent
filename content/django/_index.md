# Django

Django is a powerful web framework built with Python that helps you create dynamic websites quickly and efficiently. Instead of manually coding every page, Django lets you use templates to automatically generate pages with fresh data—such as blog posts or user profiles.

Django also simplifies connecting your site to a database, making it easy to store and manage information like user comments or product listings. Plus, Django comes with built-in features like user authentication and security, so you can focus on building your site without reinventing the wheel.

### What will you learn during the tutorial?

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have built a fully functional Django application that showcases a Bakery Finder app for discovering the best local bakeries and their delicious offerings all at your fingertips.

You’ll learn how to structure your project with Django’s models, views, and templates, and you'll add the finishing touches with custom styling to make your site visually appealing. We’ll even guide you through deploying your app online so that everyone can explore your bakeries and their offerings!

### What is the difference between building a website in Django vs HTML/CSS?

- **HTML/CSS websites are static:** You need to code each page by hand, which is fine for simple, unchanging content but not for interactive sites.
- **Django:** If you want a website that updates itself and interacts with users, Django is an excellent, beginner-friendly choice.
