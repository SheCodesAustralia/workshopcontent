# What is Django?

Django is a powerful web framework built with Python that helps you create dynamic websites quickly and efficiently. Instead of manually coding every page, Django lets you use templates to automatically generate pages with fresh dataâ€”such as blog posts or user profiles.

Django also simplifies connecting your site to a database, making it easy to store and manage information like user comments or product listings. Plus, Django comes with built-in features like user authentication and security, so you can focus on building your site without reinventing the wheel.

## What is the difference between building a website in Django vs HTML/CSS?

- **HTML/CSS websites are static:** You need to code each page by hand, which is fine for simple, unchanging content but not for interactive sites.
- **Django:** If you want a website that updates itself and interacts with users, Django is an excellent, beginner-friendly choice.
