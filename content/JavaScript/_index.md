Welcome to our She Codes Australia One Day Workshop. We've put together a fun little tutorial to give you a coding taster for a mini game. 

The tutorial teaches you the Javscript component of our cupcake smashing game. You can take your time and read through concepts to understand more about JavaScript, or you can fly through the content and have fun smashing cupcakes! 

At She Codes we firmly believe that coding is **ALWAYS** better with cupcakes!

A preview of the end result is below:

Ready to get started? Awesome! Proceed to Step 1.

New to coding? No problem! Let's begin with a short video about HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the three programming languages that we use to build websites and will be referencing throughout this tutorial.
