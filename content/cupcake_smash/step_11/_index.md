### Don't stop!

But your coding journey doesnâ€™t have to stop here - JavaScript is an immensely powerful coding language and there are dozens of ways you could customise or improve your game.

Try out some of our suggestions below or add your own coding flair.

### Style it baby!

If you already understand a little HTML & CSS, you can add some of your own styling, or even a tagline with your name to your game so that everyone who sees it knows who the creator was! You could also add some additional animation to the 'smash' (clicking on the cupcake) with some kind of explosion or graphic.

### Next Level Challenges

Why stop at 10 seconds? You could create multiple levels with variations each time. For example, you might increase the speed each round so that it becomes harder and harder. You could set a 'minimum score' that the user needs to beat to pass the level!

### Variable Scoring

You might have noticed that there are different cupcakes that display - you could randomise which cupcake shows each time, and give the different cupcakes a different number of points each. You could also introduce decoys - maybe you lose points if you accidentally click a different gem instead of a cupcake!

### Keep Experimenting!

The possibilities are endless. Whether you add new features or simply polish the look and feel of your game, every tweak is a chance to learn something new.
